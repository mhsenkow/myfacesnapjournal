# Mastodon Integration Test Guide

## âœ… **OAuth Flow Fixed!**

I've fixed the OAuth callback handling issue. The problem was that the popup callback detection wasn't working reliably. Now it uses a more robust approach with `postMessage` communication.

## **What I Fixed:**

1. **Improved OAuth Callback Handling** - Uses `postMessage` instead of polling the popup URL
2. **Enhanced Callback Page** - The callback page now properly extracts and sends the authorization code
3. **Added Debugging** - Console logs to help troubleshoot any issues
4. **Better Error Handling** - More specific error messages

## **How to Test:**

1. **Open your app**: Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Click Settings â†’ Integrations tab
3. **Connect to Mastodon**: Click "Connect to Mastodon"
4. **Choose Instance**: Select mastodon.social (or any instance)
5. **Authorize**: Click "Authorize on Mastodon" 
6. **Complete OAuth**: You'll see the Mastodon authorization screen (like in your screenshot)
7. **Click Authorize**: Click the purple "Authorize" button
8. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools to see the debug logs
9. **Verify Connection**: You should see "Connected as [username]" in the app

## **Debug Information:**

The app now logs detailed information to the browser console:
- OAuth callback received
- Token exchange progress  
- User info fetching
- Any errors that occur

## **Expected Flow:**

1. âœ… Client registration with Mastodon instance
2. âœ… OAuth popup opens with authorization URL
3. âœ… User authorizes on Mastodon (your screenshot)
4. âœ… Callback page receives authorization code
5. âœ… Code sent back to main app via postMessage
6. âœ… Token exchange with Mastodon API
7. âœ… User profile fetched
8. âœ… Authentication stored and UI updated

## **If It Still Doesn't Work:**

Check the browser console for error messages. The most common issues are:

- **CORS errors**: Some Mastodon instances might block cross-origin requests
- **Network issues**: Check if the instance is accessible
- **Client registration fails**: Some instances might not allow dynamic registration

## **Test with Different Instances:**

Try these popular instances:
- `mastodon.social` (largest instance)
- `mastodon.online` 
- `mstdn.social`
- `mastodon.art` (art community)

The integration should now work end-to-end! ðŸš€
